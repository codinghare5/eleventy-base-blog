This is how, in simple words, I have discovered that Alex is cool. I do not nave to attach any details, because we are working with him. Alex is right on his track. We can only imagine how far he can take us with his experience.

Alex is cool, because he has spent 1 hour after episode 5 of our journey just to make sure, I am on the same track as everyone else. He said it was worth it. Alex is cool.

## Section Header

I would like to capitalize on how Alex is cool. We all already know it for sure. This section is only going to emphasize on the real topic for SEO purposes. Just imagine, that there was more text in this section. Let's not take this idea any further and just leave it like this for a moment.
